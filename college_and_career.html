                <p> Introduction: I want to pursue into the computer science field and become a software engineer.</p>
                <p> Educational Journey: Since when I was a kid I was always interested in technology. My interested started to spike when I took
                    a
                    robotics class in
                    Junior High. I was fasinated on how we can controll and move the robots. I wanted to become a robotics
                    engineer, until I went into
                    a computer science class. I was more interested in writing code on software than on robots. It seems
                    easy
                    and so interesting
                    creating things inside a software. So I have started the path to become a software engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    College and University plans: I want to get into UC Berekely, UCLA, Stanford, or USC as a Computer Science major. I would go to other
                    schools outside of California
                    but it's kinda of expensive and I want to stay close with my family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Career Aspirations: I want to work in software coding, so I would want to be a software engineer. I would like to work on
                    setting
                    up websites, fixing websites, and working on video games. I would like to work at apple, google, or
                    sony.
                </p>
                <p> Future Plans: I want to work as a software developer because I want to help companies with any problems with software
                    or
                    by help making a website or video game. This would help the economy if more buisnesses start to form and
                    I
                    would want people
                    to be entertained by video games.
