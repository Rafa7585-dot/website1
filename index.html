            <h1 id="title">Brief Bio:</h1>
            <p id="description">
            <p>My name is Rafael Salgado and I was born on April 14, 2006 in Anaheim, California. In my childhood years
                I
                was a little chubby and
                not stressed out all the time. But, during quarantine I had starting to ose weight, as I started to
                exercise
                at home. Throughout
                my highschool years I had gotten all A's(except one class in freshman year I got a B+ because the
                teacher
                didn't like me). But
                Senior year has been the most stressful year for me because I am taking 4 AP classes, a dual enrollment
                class, I am vice president
                for a club called CSF, I am captain of my soccer team, I am in Key Club and in BROS, and I am working on
                my
                college applications. Although
                it's stressful, I still have fun this year because of my friends.
